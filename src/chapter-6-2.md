Before diving into specific strategies, it is important to understand the concept of employee motivation. Employee motivation refers to the internal and external factors that drive individuals to take action, achieve goals, and maintain enthusiasm for their work. It plays a significant role in shaping employee behavior, performance, and overall job satisfaction.
